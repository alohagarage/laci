    <h1>Information Architecture Research</h1>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Background Research</h3>
      <h4>Technical Requirements</h4>
      <p>High quality user experience for both students and instructors</p>
      <p>Acessible to non-UT users</p>
      <p>Payment Options (Credit Card)</p>
      <p>Extensible to other courses (platform)</p>
      <h4>Existing Assets</h4>
      <ul>

      <h3>Stakeholder Interviews</h3>
      <p>One of the primary purposes of center is to provide realistic view of 
      working world. Reality testing.
      </p>
      <p>
      Providing extra materials would be a good way to add value.
      </p>
      <p>
      Online courses should be straightforward and easy to use. Don't make 
      learners waste time learning how to use system.
      </p>
      <p>Content strategies have been tried before (blog), but were abandoned.
      Making a low-impact, sustainable content strategy is very important.
      </p>
      <p>
      Name recognition of companies a big driver of foot traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
      Personalized support is what all Stakeholders consider to be their main 
      constribution. Doubt if this can be mimicked online. Try to shift boilerplate, 
      "guides" to online.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li><h3>Technology Assessment</h3>
      <p>
      Canvas: An open-source (dual license) LMS written in Ruby. Canvas has 
      hooks for building new plugins. UT has the hosted version (not the open 
      version). What UT's version can do will be a subset of what is possible 
      for Canvas as a whole. Provides integration for Google Docs, content 
      delivery. Worst case scenario, I can write Ruby plugins for Canvas.
      </p>
      <p>
      Continuing Ed: Continuing ed has already dealt with a mixed enrollment of 
      UT/non-UT and taking payment. LAITS will try to assess how this is done.
      </p>
      <p>
      CTL will be the point of contact for Canvas and Google at UT.
      </p>
      <p>
      Content Production: echo360 can record lecture in class. LAITS has facilities 
      to record lectures as well.

    <h2>Users</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>User Personas</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The first type of user is generally eager to get a head start on 
          their career search. They are often career-oriented and 
          ambitious and seek concrete guidance on what steps they can take 
          further their career. In ths case of Economics major, they may feel 
          an element of resentment that their career options are more limited 
          than business majors. The business program and business students may 
          be an object of admiration or envy.</li>
          <li>The second type of user may feel that they are behind the ball. 
          May exhibit signs of despair, self-doubt. Many have not seriously 
          considered their career path. These users may benefit from more self-discovery. 
          Because they haven't set their mind on a career, they may be more 
          open to a variety of options than their more driven counterparts. 
          Grad students fall into this group of users.</li>
